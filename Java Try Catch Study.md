# Java Try Catch Study
The `try/catch` blocks are used to handle potential errors in the code. The `try` contains the code that may cause an error. If an error occurs, the `catch` comes into action to handle it and prevent the program from stopping. The `finally` is an optional block that performs tasks that should be done regardless of whether an error has occurred or not. It's a way to ensure that your program keeps running smoothly, even when things don't go as planned.
